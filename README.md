## Overview

Welcome to the CTF Assessment Report repository! This project features a detailed analysis of my findings from a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition organized by Lostar Information Security. The assessment involved penetration testing on several newly released machines on Hack The Box, identifying flags, and documenting the security vulnerabilities discovered along with the methodologies used.

## Contents

- Detailed assessment reports for the Hack The Box machines "[Previse](https://github.com/MertKRC/CTF-Assessment-Report/blob/main/Lostar_Previse_Report.pdf)," "[Seal](https://github.com/MertKRC/CTF-Assessment-Report/blob/main/Lostar_Seal_Report.pdf)," and "[Writer](https://github.com/MertKRC/CTF-Assessment-Report/blob/main/Lostar_Writer_Report.pdf)" including identified vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and recommended remediation.
